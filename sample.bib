	abstract = {Monolithic silica gel with macropores was prepared in the solution of water glass and polyacrylic acid ({HPAA)} by freezing transitional structures of phase separation. In the system, phase separation proceeds between silica polymers and {HPAA}, so that the porous morphology varies from closed macropores to particle aggregates through bicontinuous morphology, where both macropores and silica skeleton are three-dimensionally interconnected, with increasing {HPAA/silica} ratio. In addition, we can control the macropore size in bicontinuous morphology by varying the concentration of both silica and {HPAA}, or by changing the molecular weight of {HPAA.} The pore size distribution is quite sharp indicating the presence of pores with the same size all through the monolithic samples.},
